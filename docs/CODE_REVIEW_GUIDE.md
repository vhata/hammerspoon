# Code review

Read when asked for a full or incremental codebase review, when a PR resolves a review finding, or when delegating and reviewing agent work. PR review checks one change; codebase review checks accumulated interactions and maintains the finding inventory in [review/](../review/).

## PR review (every change)

Every PR that changes code is reviewed by an agent that did not write it, including the coordinator's own code and integration changes. The reviewer reads the whole diff and surrounding code, independently reruns the decisive checks, reproduces claimed "before" behaviour, proves behaviour-neutral claims on an input the author did not use, and mutation-tests new tests. The reviewer reports findings with location, failure scenario and evidence; it does not edit the branch. Authors fix; the reviewer confirms the fixes against the original failure. The PR body then records:

```md
## Review
Independent review by <agent> at <commit>: <verdict>. Verified: <claims and how>. Findings: <n> (<fixed in <commit> | disposition>). Not checked: <gaps>.
```

Focus areas for this project: blocking calls on Hammerspoon's main thread (`hs.execute`, synchronous network fetches, AppleScript), event taps and global hotkeys that swallow or misfire on ordinary input, accidental globals, objects that must stay referenced to avoid garbage collection (watchers, taps, timers), shell commands built from unquoted input, and screen geometry that assumes a single display at the origin.

## Ledger

- `review/README.md` indexes snapshots newest first with type, reviewed commit (a commit on `main`) and open count at close. The top row is the next incremental review's baseline; the newest Full row is the baseline for cumulative churn.
- `review/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-full.md` / `-incremental.md` (UTC) are immutable once merged, except for factual corrections to the review itself. Status changes are recorded by the next snapshot, never by the PR that fixes a finding.
- `review/BACKLOG.md` is the mutable queue of findings promoted into separate work; see [TODO_GUIDE.md](TODO_GUIDE.md).

### Snapshot skeleton

```md
# <Full|Incremental> review, YYYY-MM-DD

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Full / Incremental |
| Reviewed commit | `<sha>` on main |
| Previous review | <file> at `<sha>` / None |
| Reviewers | <coordinator; independent agents and the areas each covered> |
| Baseline | `bash scripts/check.sh`: <result>; `bash scripts/e2e.sh`: <result>; <other baseline commands>: <results> |

### Finding format

```md
- `immutable-finding-slug` — **One-sentence title.** Kind · Status · Verification.
  - Where: `path:line` (`symbol`) at the reviewed commit.
  - Severity: P0..P3.
  - Failure scenario, evidence and suggested correction in one to four sentences.
  - Review backlog: `mapped-backlog-slug`
```

Kinds: Bug, Design, Duplication, Performance, Test, Style, Tooling, Docs, Security. Verification: **Verified** (executed or reproduced) or **Read** (inspection). Statuses: **Open**, **Moved** (open at a new location), **Fixed**, **Accepted** (reason), **Invalid** (evidence), **Superseded** (replacement slug). Every non-open status carries evidence. Closed entries are one line each with reference, location at the reviewed commit, and confirmation:

```md
- `finding-slug` — Fixed in #45 (f10a8e2). `path:line` (`symbol`): what the code now does. Original reproduction rerun; no longer reproduces.
```

One finding is one independently fixable, verifiable problem; repeated instances of one smell are one finding listing every site.

## Baseline checks

Run at the reviewed commit and record exact results in the header:

```bash
bash scripts/check.sh
# No headless runtime exists: behaviour is checked by reloading the live config in Hammerspoon and reading its console.
```

A check that passed at the previous review and fails now is a finding.

## Full review

1. Record the reviewed commit and run the baseline.
2. Read all maintained source, tests and configuration; delegate independent areas to parallel agents and confirm every claim against the source before recording it.
3. Reproduce serious bugs (Verified); the rest stay Read.
4. Review-close triage (below).
5. Write the snapshot, amend the invariants, add the index row.
6. Open the review as its own PR. It carries no code fixes; small factual documentation fixes may be separate commits on the review branch, recorded as Fixed.

## Incremental review

Base is the newest snapshot's reviewed commit.

1. Baseline, recorded.
2. Re-check every standing finding by reading current code. For merged PRs carrying `Resolves review finding: <slug>`, inspect the code at the new commit, record the new location, rerun the original reproduction (Verified) or repeat the inspection (Read). Unconfirmed closures stay Open or Moved with their backlog mapping restored.
3. Read the whole delta against the invariants and standing findings; a new copy of a listed duplication is a finding.
4. Mechanical checks: `bash scripts/workflow/check-links.sh`, `bash scripts/workflow/check-queues.sh --strict`, counts of lint suppressions and in-code TODO/FIXME markers, largest files, stray tracked files, and this project's drift checks: hotkeys and leader bindings documented in README.md against `init.lua` and the modules; QUALITY.md against hooks and CI. Compare every number with the previous snapshot.
5. Re-read files touched by most PRs in the delta.
6. Review-close triage, snapshot, index row, review PR.

A full review resets the baseline after a large refactor, when a hot file was rewritten, when most findings are closed and a clean baseline is wanted, when two consecutive incremental reviews each added many findings, or when `bash scripts/workflow/review-due.sh` reports source churn above a third of the codebase.

## Review-close triage

For every Open or Moved finding at close, exactly one decision, recorded in the mapping table: map to an existing backlog entry; promote into a new coherent ready entry (verified or user-visible bug, structural change that unblocks work, or a batch of small defects in one area); keep as inventory with a reason; or fix now when it is a small documentation edit. Promotion is not authorisation to implement.

## Fixing a finding

Select by explicit assignment first, otherwise from `review/BACKLOG.md` by priority. Raw findings without a backlog entry are inventory, not a queue. The fix PR claims its backlog slug and each finding in scope, opens with `## Why`, and includes in `## Validation` a human-runnable scenario: setup, actions, the old failure, the expected corrected result (or, for tooling and docs, the command or inspection and its success condition). "Tests pass" alone is not a scenario. The independent reviewer verifies the fix against the original failure before the PR is ready. When the PR lands, add the finding to the Pending reconciliation list in `review/README.md` (finding, fix PR and commit, reviewer, evidence). The next incremental review owns closure and clears that list.
